# Sense-Spectrum
These are the codes of our Sense Spectrum model proposed in our paper "Preserve the Hypernym Tree in WordNet by Dense Embeddings". One may download all the files and put them in one folder. Then, under this folder, please create a folder named 'checkpoints'. After that, running the sense_spectrum.py will give the sense spectra of noun and verb synsets in WordNet. This training will take about 20 hours, depending on the capacity of the GPU and CPU. After training, four files will be generated automatically: noun_synsets, noun_spectra, verb_synsets and verb_spectra. These files recording the synsets and their corresponding trained spectra. To further assist interested researchers, we have uploaded these files here.
 
Running the sense_spectrum_HIS will give the results on the SimLex-999 dataset from the HIS measurement as well as the three basic measurements in WordNet (please see our paper for detailed description). As described in our paper, we run all these four measurements on noun pairs, verb pairs and combining both noun and verb ones in the SimLex-999 dataset. To run on noun pairs, simply comment out the codes for verb pairs; And vise versa.
